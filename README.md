# School District Analysis

## Background
School district analysis is helping school board and mayor to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. Analysis was made on the 2-csv data provided, which including the schools and studentsâ€™ information. With the help of Jupyter Notebook the code written to obtain the desired result.

## Analysis

To get the district summary, calculation was made to find out:
1.	total number of unique schools
2.	total number of students
3.	total budget
4.	average (mean) math score
5.	average (mean) reading score.
6.	percentage of students who passed math.
7.	percentage of students who passed reading.
8.	percentage of students that passed math and reading.

Data frame was created to get the output of the above calculations. District Summary is as below.

Further continued to calculate the School Summary

1.	School types.
2.	total student count per school.
3.	total school budget and per capita spending per school.
4.	average test scores per school
5.	number of students per school with math scores of 70 or higher
6.	number of students per school with reading scores of 70 or higher
7.	students per school that passed both math and reading.
8.	calculate the passing rates.


Data frame here is helping to investigate the school summary as one table.

Analysis was taken a little bit deeper to get the results. Started looking into following:


1.	Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
2.	Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
3.	Math Scores by Grade
4.	Reading Score by Grade
5.	Scores by School Spending
